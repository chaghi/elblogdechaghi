|    Speak to me with tenderness 
|    Speak to me with gracefulness 
|    Speak to me with happiness and love
|
|    Speak to me in loneliness 
|    Speak to me in bitterness
|    Speak to me in faithlessness with love
|
|    You want to hide when you’re alone 
|    Where do you run to when you’re on your own?
|    You’re looking to find some peace of mind
|    But nothing’s in sight at the end of the line, oh no
|
|    Speak to me in emptiness
|    Speak to me in failed success 
|    Speak to me in speechlessness with love
|
|    You want to hide when you’re alone 
|    Where do you run to when everything’s gone? 
|    You’re looking to find a good thing in life 
|    But nothing’s in sight at the end of the line
|
|    So where do you hide when you’re alone? 
|    Where do you run to when you’re on your own? 
|    That dream in the dark just sank like a stone 
|    That voice in your heart, 
|    It won’t come to the phone, 
|    It never comes?
|
|                            -- Letra y música de Per Gessle.

No se bien por que, *Speak To Me* es, para mi, el mejor tema de Charm
School.
