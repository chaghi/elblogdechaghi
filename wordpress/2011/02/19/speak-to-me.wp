<html><body><blockquote>Speak to me with tenderness

Speak to me with gracefulness

Speak to me with happiness and love

<p>Speak to me in loneliness

Speak to me in bitterness

Speak to me in faithlessness with love</p>

<p>You want to hide when you’re alone

Where do you run to when you’re on your own?

You’re looking to find some peace of mind

But nothing’s in sight at the end of the line, oh no

Speak to me in emptiness

Speak to me in failed success

Speak to me in speechlessness with love</p>

<p>You want to hide when you’re alone

Where do you run to when everything’s gone?

You’re looking to find a good thing in life

But nothing’s in sight at the end of the line</p>

<p>So where do you hide when you’re alone?

Where do you run to when you’re on your own?

That dream in the dark just sank like a stone

That voice in your heart,

It won’t come to the phone,

It never comes?</p></blockquote>

<p>No se bien por que, <em>Speak To Me</em> es, para mi, el mejor tema de Charm School.</p></body></html>
